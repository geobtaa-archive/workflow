  "dc_description_s": "This is a polygon layer at1:250,000 scale containing depth-to-water table estimates used in preparing the GCSM for Wisconsin. The depth to water table is the distance from the land surface to the water table. The distance water must flow to reach the groundwater, combined with the ease with which movement occurs, play a significant role in determining the susceptibility of an area to contamination.",
