  "dc_description_s": "COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_DNR_IN.SHP contains the entrance locations of all documented underground coal mine entrances that have operated in the coal region of Indiana since the mid-1880s, up to December 31, 2016. COAL_MINE_ENTRIES_DNR_IN.SHP is attributed to allow the mine entrances to be differentiated based on entrance type (hoist shaft, other shafts, slope, unknown), depth, mine number, and source information (map number).  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR, Division of Reclamation, for the source point feature class named \"COAL_ENTRY_GEOREF\":  \"Coal_Mine_Entries_DNR_IN is a compilation of all documented underground coal mine entrances in Indiana. Coal_Mine_Entries_DNR_IN was compiled by the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) as part of a contract deliverable for the Abandoned Mine Lands program of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation. Coal_Mine_Entries_DNR_IN incorporates mine entrance locations compiled as part of the Indiana Coal Mine Information System (CMIS), an integrated geographic information system (GIS) and database management system (DBMS) created to store, analyze, and help distribute coal mine data in Indiana. The system contains data for surface and underground coal mines that operated in Indiana from the mid-1830s to 2007. Original source information for Coal_Mine_Entries_DNR_IN includes company mine maps, field maps and notes of IGS geologists, IGS publications, and Reports of the Indiana State Mine Inspector. All mine data included in Coal_Mine_Entries_DNR_IN are organized in a GIS using ESRI ArcGIS software of the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) on the Windows platform. Scale of source data ranges from 1:4,800 to 1:100,000.\"",
