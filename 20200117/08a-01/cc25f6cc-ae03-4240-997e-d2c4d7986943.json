  "dc_description_s": "This layer shows only attaining lakes of the Integrated List. The Lakes Integrated List represents lake assessments in an integrated format for the Clean Water Act Section 305(b) reporting and Section 303(d) listing. PA DEP protects 4 lake water uses: aquatic life, fish consumption, potable water supply, and recreation. The 305(b) layers represent lakes that have been evaluated for attainment of those uses. If a lake is not attaining any one of its 4 uses, it is considered impaired. Aquatic Life use attainment - The integrity reflected in any component of the biological community (i.e. fish or fish food organisms). Fish Consumption use attainment - The risk posed to people by the consumption of aquatic organisms (ex. fish, shellfish, frogs, turtles, crayfish, etc.). Recreational use attainment - The risk associated with human recreation activities in or on a water body (i.e. exposure to bacteria and other disease causing organisms through water contact recreation like swimming or water skiing). Potable Water Supply use attainment - The risk posed to people by the ingestion of drinking water. Lakes that have appeared on an approved Category 5 Integrated Listing are the entries labeled as approved. Integrated Lists are submitted for approval every other year. Lakes entered subsequent to the latest approved Category 5 listing are labeled tentative. After appearing on an approved listing, the tentative entries move to approved. The Lake Integrated List is provided as two separate layers determined if the lake is attaining or not attaining its designated uses. DEP Lakes Integrated List layers are maintained by the PADEP Office of Water Management, Bureau of Water Supply & Wastewater Management, Water Quality Assessment and Standards Division. The layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Additional update information is provided by Bureau of Watershed Management, Water Use Planning Division.",
