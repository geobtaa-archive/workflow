  "dc_description_s": "A 1% Annual Chance Flood Depth Grid represents the height of a 100 year flood surface elevation above ground or bottom of a stream channel measured in feet. The values are captured per cell of a defined area. The cell size for 1% Annual Chance Flood Depth Grids is variable. It is calculated by subtracting the height of the ground surface elevation from the surface height of the 1% annual chance flood. A Flood Depth Grid can assist a community in understanding, communicating, and relaying the variability and severity of flooding in a mapped floodplain.",
