The RCO system is designed to improve community notification of proposed developments and make community involvement more predictable across the city. RCOs became effective on August 22, 2012. Polygon boundaries of Registered Community Organizations (RCO) as established under Section 14-303 (12) of the City of Philadelphia Zoning Code enacted December 15, 2011 and made effective August 22, 2012.
