  "dc_description_s": "This dataset identifies and scores potential riparian planting sites across Pennsylvania. Planting sites are based on 100-foot buffers around NHD High Resolution streams, areas, and water bodies. Qualifying areas have at least 0.25 acres of Low Vegetation land cover on a single tax parcel. Land cover data came from the 1-m High Resolution Land Cover produced by the Chesapeake Conservancy and University of Vermont. Sites are scored using a 0-3 score that combines Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Trapping Efficiency, and upslope land cover. This version of the prioritization data converts each planting site polygon to a point. It is best suited for distant, small-scale mapping and analyses.",
