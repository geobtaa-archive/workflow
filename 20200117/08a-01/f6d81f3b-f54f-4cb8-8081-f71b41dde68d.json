  "dc_description_s": "This data layer includes point locations for Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI) data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory System (TRIS) for all States in EPA Region 3 (PA, MD, DE, DC, VA, WV). This data layer includes yearly information by State about the facilities that report releases and the types of chemicals being released. TRI includes information from facilities on the amounts of over 300 listed toxic chemicals that the facilities release directly to air, water, or land or that are transported (transferred) off-site. TRI was mandated by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) which is based on the premise that citizens have a right to know about toxic chemicals in their communities. TRI's purpose is to encourage planning for response to chemical accidents and to provide the public and government information about possible chemical hazards in communities.",
