  "dc_description_s": "This is a set of the impaired waterbodies as determined by MPCA's surface water quality assessment process finalized under the 2014 reporting cycle to US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Waterbodies declared impaired prior to 2014 are also included in this dataset unless they have been delisted. These waterbodies are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include a feature that MPCA has assessed, a feature is added by MPCA. Since the impaired waterbodies are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset. This dataset includes impaired waterbodies that have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA.",
