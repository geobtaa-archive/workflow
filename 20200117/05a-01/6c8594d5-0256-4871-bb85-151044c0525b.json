  "dc_description_s": "This dataset shows where largescale tree canopy damage was delineated in aerial surveys in 2017. Forests in northern and central Minnesota were surveyed (<a href=\"survey_map.jpg\" target=_blank>Flight Map</a>). Forests south of northern Washington and Anoka counties were not surveyed. Only forest disturbances were mapped if they were occurring at the time of the flight. Flights occurred from late June to late August. The following were the most common disturbers, listed from largest area disturbed to smallest area disturbed: eastern larch beetle, spruce budworm, forest tent caterpillar, larch casebearer, aspen decline, shoot blight on northern white cedar, flooding, wind, jack pine budworm, black ash decline, twolined chestnut borer, hail, bark beetles on pines, and oak wilt. Not included in this dataset are unknown causes of damage.",
