  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains 265 digital, black and white orthophoto quarter-quadrangles (DOQs), 3.75' x 3.75', covering the 7 county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota.  Each CD-ROM contains up to 4 quarter-quadrangles of a USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, where a quarter-quadrangle is included IF it's coverage includes any portion of the Twin cities 7 county area.  The orthophotos are in UTM, Zone 15, NAD83 projection.  Each image is approximately 120 Mb, with a .6 meter image pixel, and available in TIFF format.  There are a total of 76 CD-ROMs plus one CD-ROM that contains one metadata record for the dataset and a header file (.hdr) for each image.  These DOQs were produced using the USGS DOQ specifications except for the scan resolution (pixel size is .6m rather than 1 meter) and the file format.  The original imagery was collected at 20,000 ft and centered on USGS quarter-quads.  This dataset is available for direct use via the MnGeo Geospatial Image Service (Twin Cities metro layer).
