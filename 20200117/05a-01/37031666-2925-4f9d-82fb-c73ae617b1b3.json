The Transit Capital Levy Communities dataset includes all the communities in the transit taxing district on 1/1/2001 AND communities that have come to an agreement with the Metropolitan Council to levy in their community for transit capital.  The transit taxing district was the area in which all taxable property was assessed a tax to be used for payment of transit and paratransit services per Minn. Stat. 473.446.  This area was comprised of whole cities, townships and unorganized territories.",
