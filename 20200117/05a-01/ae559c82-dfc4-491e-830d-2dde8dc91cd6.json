  "dc_description_s": "This file is a geodatabase that contains public school program locations in the state of Minnesota for school years 2002/03 - 2008/09. Before SY2009-10, school program locations were stored in separate files for different school programs (public, nonpublic, and charter, and public school district center). Beginning in 2009 program locations were combined into one file and attributes are used to distinguish the school types. Files for years after 2009 are posted seperately (see Associated Data Sets). Each file in this group was developed from annual information and is now provided as historical information. This metadata summarizes the content of these files but individual metadata records are also included for each annual file  The point locations of school programs are a result of an ongoing project to identify current school program locations where Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) programs are utilized. The FNS Office is in the Department of Education.  GIS at MDE modified the data set using school building locations provided by the school districts and program locations from an MDE database. The records cover traditional K-12 programs. New for SY2006-07 were Charter and other public schools or buildings that are a part of the public school system. These were added to the public schools and are delineated using separate attributes (see lineage). Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate points. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record and point in the data layer.",
