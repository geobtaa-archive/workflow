  "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains leaf-off, 4-band (red, green, blue, near-infrared (RGBI)) digital orthophoto imagery of the Twin Cities metropolitan area in east-central Minnesota. 268 digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) tiles were produced at 30-cm (1-foot) resolution from new aerial photography captured in the spring of 2016. The counties of Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington were originally captured at 30-cm resolution. DOQQ tiles covering Anoka, Carver, Dakota and Scott counties were created from higher resolution 15-cm (6-inch) imagery and resampled down to 30-cm resulting in a uniform resolution for the entire project area.  Project partners include the Metropolitan Council, the Minnesota IT Services' Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo), the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District, and Anoka, Carver, Dakota and Scott counties.  This dataset is available for direct use via the MnGeo Geospatial Image Service (Twin Cities metro layer). More information at http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/wms/geo_image_server.html   This metadata record was created by MnGeo using information supplied by Surdex Corporation, the Metropolitan Council and the Minnesota Department of Transportation.",
