  "dc_description_s": "This data set contains 4-band (natural color plus infrared) imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The source files are 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from NAIP. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county. JPEG2000 compression was used. Target values for the compression ratio are (15:1).  (Note: MnGeo has created this metadata record to describe the entire NAIP2008 dataset, using information from Farm Service Agency metadata. Each county file is accompanied by the original FSA metadata for that county.)  The downloadable shapefile represents a statewide quarter-quadrangle tile index that indicates the date that each image was flown.",
