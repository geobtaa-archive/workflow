These forecasts are for the old TAZ system with 1,566 zones.

IMPORTANT NOTES:   These TAZ forecasts will change multiple times over the next few years.   The Metropolitan Council will ask cities and townships to allocate their TAZ forecasts as part of their 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update (go to  http://www.metrocouncil.org/Handbook/Plan-Elements/Transportation.aspx  for more information about this process). Communities may also revise their current TAZ forecasts before the 2018 Comprehensive Plan Update.   In the meantime, the Council provides these Current TAZ forecasts for transportation planning.  If you are using TAZ forecasts for analysis and/or transportation planning, please download the latest version of this shapefile to ensure you are using the most up-to-date data.  If you represent a community that wants to revise your TAZ forecasts, please contact your community's sector representative or  Dennis Farmer (see contact information at the end of this document).",
