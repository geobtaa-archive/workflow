The Growth Boundary designates the areas that may be eligible to receive public water and service and provides the demarcation between the Rural and Agricultural Areas and future growth areas. The Growth Boundary follows property lines and municipal boundaries. The Growth Boundary may be changed through General Plan amendment (such as through the approval of a new master or sector plan).
