It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Waupaca_HydroPoly_2014.gdb. [The hydrography coverage was created to represent rivers, water bodies and other hydrographic phenomena in Waupaca County. Hydrologic features were derived from the May 1994 flight with a flight height of 10,000 feet. The hydrologic feature layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village. The layer is based on the Waupaca County Coordinate System (WCCS).]",
