  "dc_description_s": "This line data layer represents census roads for Wisconsin in 2010. It is a feature class within the geodatabase, WI_CensusRoads_2010.gdb. Data layers included in the geodatabase are the 'Roads.shp' and 'Major_Roads.shp' but the metadata was created from the 'Roads.shp' file.[The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The All Roads Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Super Class 'Road/Path Features' distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB tha begin with 'S'. This includes all primary, secondary, local neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, vehicular trails (4wd), ramps, service drives, alleys, parking lot roads, private roads for service vehicles (logging, oil fields, ranches, etc.), bike paths or trails, bridle/horse paths, walkways/pedestrian trails, and stairways.]",
