The feature layers included in this geodatabase are 'Manitowoc_General_2018' and 'Manitowoc_Shoreland_2018'. [This map data layer represents the zoning district boundaries for the towns in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin that have adopted the county's zoning ordiance. The ordinary high water mark of navigable water features were delineated using Manitowoc County's 2017 digital orthophotograph and 2 ft. contours and breaklines created from a 2015 LiDAR project. Lakes, ponds, and flowages were then buffered by 1000 feet. Rivers, streams, and creeks were buffered by 300 feet.]",
