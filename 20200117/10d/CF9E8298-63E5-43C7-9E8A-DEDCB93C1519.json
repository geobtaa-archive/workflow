The GCSM was developed by the DNR, the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey (WGNHS), and the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison in the mid-1980s. The results of the GCSM are illustrated in a map published in 1987 at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (available from the Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey: http://wgnhs.uwex.edu/maps-data/maps/",
