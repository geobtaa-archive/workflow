  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents zoning for the City of Superior in Douglas County, Wisconsin in 2010. [Zoning districts are established to promote compatible patterns of land use within the city limits. Zoning districts also establish site development regulations and performance standards appropriate to the purposes and the uses allowed in each district. Distinct zoning districts exist for residential, office, retail and industrial uses. Furthermore, specific use restrictions, site development regulations or performance standards may apply to zoning districts combined with special overlay or combining districts. As part of the zoning process, appropriate land uses for an area are identified based on such factors as the intensity, density, height of a proposed project, surrounding land uses, traffic impacts and access to a site, environmental concerns and overall compatibility. Zoning changes may be required for a change of land use or alteration of a building or site within the city limits.]",
