  "dc_description_s": "WATER_QUALITY_STATISTICS_EPA_IN is a point shapefile developed by the USEPA BASINS 3.0 program and edited by Bernardin, Lochmueller and Associates. Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occurring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky and Ohio. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters.  US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports -  \"This data set provides statistical summaries of water quality monitoring for 47 physical and chemical-related parameters. The parameter specific statistics were computed by station for 5-year intervals from 1970 to 1994 and a three year interval from 1995 to 1997. The data are extracted from the U.S. EPA Storage and Retrieval of US Waters Parametric Data (STORET) which is contributed by a number of organizations including federal, state, interstate agencies, universities, contractors, individuals and water laboratories. Data updates are performed weekly. Each provider of data is responsible for the data it submits to STORET. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format.\"",
