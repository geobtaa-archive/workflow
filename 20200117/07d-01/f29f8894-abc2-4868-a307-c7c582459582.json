  "dc_description_s": "Relief shown pictorially. Inset map of Orcades Insulae (the Orkneys). A cherub sits on either side of the inset, each holding a cornucopia. Title cartouche has cherubim, vines, suits of armor, and a coat of arms at the top flanked by a unicorn and a lion wearing a crown. Vignette at right shows three mermaids, each bearing a flag with a coat of arms on it, and the leftmost one also holds a spiky conch shell. On the left side of the map, one ship fires its cannon at another. Date on the map reads 1631 but this map was included in a composite atlas published at a later date.

From the Appendix Atlas of the British Isles and Northern Europe, title created to represent a unique collection within the Clark Library, University of Michigan. 1 map: 37 x 51 cm.
