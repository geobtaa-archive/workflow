It is a feature class within the geodatabase, Brown_Parcels_2015.gdb. [TaxParcel depicts parcels of land as polygon features. Attributes include ParcelType, ParcelID, LegalLabel, MapAreaTxt, CSM, Lot, Municipality and more. The ParcelType is a subtype code which indicates whether a parcel polygon is a regular Tax Parcel or if it's a Condominium. Condominiums are currently mapped as overlapping (stacked) polygons so that a 1:1 join can be used to link up tax assessment records with the parcel. For other areas of land where records are ambiguous and ownership is uncertain, ParcelType may show Gap, Overlap or Undetermined. In some areas, private roadways, public road rights-of-way, and railroad rights-of-way are also coded. ParcelID is the parcel identification number which can be used to relate or join the TaxParcel polygon to assessment records and other information. In the GeoDatabase version of this dataset, the ParcelID is set up as a 1:M Relate to various tables within the geodatabase to link ownership, tax information, assessment, and more. LegalLabel depicts the document of record that CREATED or MODIFIED the shape of the parcel (this document reference does NOT necessarily show the latest document of record (the latest document of record number is instead obtained through the joined/related table in the DocID field). The document numbers on the LegalLabel as well as the DocID number in the related table can be used to look up the deed or other document recorded in the Brown County Register of Deeds office. MapAreaTxt is the size of the parcel, generally the size recorded on the plat, CSM or other legal document. The format follows that shown on the legal document (which may be square feet -- SF -- or Acreage). If the parcel was recently created using a Certified Survey Map (CSM) then that CSM number may be recorded in the ParcelPolygon attributes, which is graphically feature-linked to the CSM text annotation on the map. Lot numbers for some of the recent parcels may also be held as an attribute. The Lot Number is based on the lot shown on the source subdivision plat or CSM. Please refer to the LotNumber annotation feature class, as this text layer contains many more lot numbers. The Lot attribute field in this parcel polygon layer is primarily used to generate feature-linked text on the map for newly-created lots. Please keep in mind that lots are often split, merged and otherwise changed from their original shape and size. In these cases, the legally-recorded lot does not change in size or shape, but the TaxParcel polygon does. MashedWorld is a computed field used to view the parcel from the Google StreetView and Microsoft Virtual Earth perspectives. Created_User and Created_Date fields in TaxParcel polygons tracks the GIS editor who digitized the parcel and the date it was digitized (NOT necessarily the date the parcel was recorded!). Last_Editied_User and Date are automatic GIS data tracking fields to indicate when a parcel was modiefied on the GIS database.]",[u'Brown County Land Information Office'],[u'Brown County Land Information Office'],Public,Wisconsin,"{""http://schema.org/downloadUrl"":""https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/Brown_Parcels_2015.zip"",""http://schema.org/url"":""http://www.co.brown.wi.us/departments/?department=85713eda4cdc&subdepartment=89ce08984457"",""http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/"":""http://64.90.181.107/geonetwork/srv/api/records/8461f1d0-3b8a-400d-968d-203710a36ee1/formatters/xml""}",8461f1d0-3b8a-400d-968d-203710a36ee1,Polygon,2018-01-04T22:36:58Z,Geodatabase,English,Dataset,"[u'Planning and Cadastral', u'Real property', u'Land ownership']",Wisconsin Counties Open Data,1/1/15,2015,"[u'Brown County, Wisconsin, United States', u'Wisconsin, United States']","ENVELOPE(-88.252631, -87.76215, 44.680133, 44.240216)","44.4601745,-88.0073905",2015

There is both an address number, which is feature-linked to annotation text on the map, as well as the full address (concatenated address number with street name). The address data were collected from many sources, some more accurate than others. To help account for accuracy, there are a 3 attribute fields to help us track and refine accuracy both in terms of location and tabular quality: First, the OnBuilding code indicates whether the address has been accurately located onto a structure identified by aerial orthophotography. Second, the 'Accuracy' code indicateds whether the CommonName (business name,etc) has been verified by County 911 staff (Note: 911 staff primarily focuses on subtype 2, the Common Names, because other general address locations are found through street centerline address ranges). Third, the source of the data is logged, especially for business information. The other fields are maintained as needed for use by the 911 and Sheriffs Dept.

There is both an address number, which is feature-linked to annotation text on the map, as well as the full address (concatenated address number with street name). The address data were collected from many sources, some more accurate than others. To help account for accuracy, there are a 3 attribute fields to help us track and refine accuracy both in terms of location and tabular quality: First, the OnBuilding code indicates whether the address has been accurately located onto a structure identified by aerial orthophotography. Second, the 'Accuracy' code indicates whether the CommonName (business name,etc) has been verified by County 911 staff (Note: 911 staff primarily focuses on subtype 2, the Common Names, because other general address locations are found through street centerline address ranges). Third, the source of the data is logged, especially for business information. The other fields are maintained as needed for use by the 911 and Sheriffs Dept.

The aerial imagery was collected on March 24th using a Microsoft Vexcel UltraCam Eagle sensor mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft. Aerial imagery was collected to support 0.5 ground sample distance (GSD) orthoimagery to meet ASPRS Class II horizontal accuracy specifications at 1' = 100' map scale. The horizontal accuracy meets or exceeds 2.0 feet RMSE using the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) standards. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to the new DEM from an existing LiDAR surface created as part of the CDBG funded WROC program. Orthoimagery was delivered in PLSS section GeoTiff and MrSID tiles and a project wide MrSID mosaic. The orthoimagery was deilvered according to a section tile schematic. The total project area is 809 sq. miles, plus a 500-ft buffer around the county boundary. Imagery collected for Wood County will additionally be used for the 2015 mapping services provided to the municipalities of Marshfield and Wisconsin Rapids. Geographic Description: Wood County is located in central Wisconsin, where the north and east parts of the county lie in the Northern Highlands region, characterized by heavily forrested lands situated at higher elevations compared to the rest of the state. Conversely, the south and west portions are in the Central Plain region, dominated by flat, marshy landscape, which provides the ideal conditions for making Wood County one of the top producers of cranberries in the state. Supplemental Information: The Wisconsin Regional Orthophotography Consortium (WROC) is a multi-entity ground led by regional planning commissions (RPCs) and WROC representatives from Ayres Associates. The goal of the consortium is to build and sustain a multi-participant program to acquire digital orthoimagery and elevation data throughout Wisconsin.
