[This dataset is a polygon map layer that contains the geographic boundaries of real property in Polk County. Real property descriptions are mapped according to the distances and bearings as described on deeds and surveys recorded at the Polk County Register of Deeds and Land Information Offices. This map layer contains one attribute field called 'PARCELID\u2019 which can also be known as a tax identification code, Parcel Identification Number (PIN), or Parcel Identification (PID). Each polygon with a numeric 12 digit code in the \u2018PARCELID\u2019 field will correspond to the same code in the Polk County tax roll. If a polygon feature DOES NOT have a known 12 digit code, descriptive text about the feature (such as APPARENT GAP) is entered in the \u2018PARCEL_ID\u2019 field for mapping purposes. A title search, to determine ownership, is needed in these cases.]",
