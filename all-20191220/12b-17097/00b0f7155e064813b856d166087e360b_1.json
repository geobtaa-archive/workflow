The features captured in this polygon dataset include: lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins, river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands. The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present. The names used for the water bodies were collected from a number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or atlases, US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions. The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83 HARN horizontal datum.",
