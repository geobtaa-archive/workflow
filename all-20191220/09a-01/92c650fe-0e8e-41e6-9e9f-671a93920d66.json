The data set provided by IDEM was in an Esri geodatabase format and the feature class was named \"SUPERFUND.\" SUPERFUND_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Federal Cleanup, Superfund, & NRDA section, Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management.  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile SUPERFUND:  \"This project is the first phase in the creation of a base locational data set to establish Geographic Information Systems as an integral part of data management for the Superfund program. Envrionmental Project Managers were trained in techniques and proper use of Global Positioning Systems.  Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites. This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA/QC'd before being deposited in a central archive.\"",
