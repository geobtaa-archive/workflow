LiDAR data are in the UTM Zone 15 coordinate system, NAD83 96, NAVD88 Geoid09 meters tiled by USGS 1/16, 1:24,000 quadrangles.  The vendor delivered the data to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in several formats:  1) One-meter digital elevation model 2) Edge-of-water breaklines 3) Classified LAS formatted point cloud data  DNR staff created four additional products: two-foot contours, building outlines, hillshades and a difference grid between this data and LiDAR data collected in 2011.   Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by Woolpert and DNR.",
