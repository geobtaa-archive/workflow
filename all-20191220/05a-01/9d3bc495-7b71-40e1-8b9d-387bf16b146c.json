The locations represent leak clean up, emergency response, petroleum brownfields, non-petroleum brownfields (Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup), Superfund, RCRA, integrated remediation and site assessment sites. The geodatabase, env_remediation_sites.gdb, contains two related datasets: (1) the remediation_sites point feature class, which has one record for each remediation site, and (2) the spatial_rem_activity table, which contains one record for each MPCA effort to investigate contamination at a site. The two datasets can be related using the ITEM_ID. In most cases, there will be one record in spatial_rem_activity for each record in remediation_sites. However, reopened leak sites may have multiple records in spatial_rem_activity for a single site, and CERCLIS/SEMS sites where the EPA was the lead agency may have zero records in spatial_rem_activity. The spatial_rem_activity table only exists in the file geodatabase format of this dataset.",
