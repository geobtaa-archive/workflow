  "dc_description_s": "This dataset was formulated to rank lakes as they relate to the state's priority of focusing on high-quality, high-value lakes that likely provide the greatest return on investment. For each lake, a benefit:cost assessment priority score was calculated. This score is a function of phosphorus sensitivity (see Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance (LPSS) dataset), lake size, and catchment disturbance. Lakes were then grouped based on this score and assigned a priority rating. Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for lake phosphorus, and this list will be periodically revised as additional data become available. For a detailed description of criteria and analysis used, see: <a href=\"ftp://ftp.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_lake_benefit_cost_assessment/metadata/Lake Benefit Cost Assessment 2018.pdf\" target=_blank>Lake Benefit:Cost Assessment Score (LBCA) - 05/14/2018</a> (pdf, 476 KB)",
